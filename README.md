Welcome to the repository of my personal website, **gpmoroni.com**.
This project serves as a digital portfolio to showcase my journey as an **AI Product Engineer**, my key projects, and my technical skills.

## Live Demo

## Tech Stack
I chose to build this website from scratch to keep the code lightweight and to refine my almost-non-existent web developer skills without relying on heavy frameworks.

* **Frontend:** Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Custom properties, Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (Vanilla).
* **Icons:** [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/).
* **Font:** Inter (Google Fonts).
* **Development Tools:** VS Code, GitHub Copilot.
